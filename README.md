Destination STEM
================

This is an archive of the Destination STEM website. (2014)

Destination STEM is a non-profit organization that offers free summer camps to young girls with the purpose of increasing their interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). I designed a logo for this organization, and I selected an appropriate color scheme. This website displays camp information, schedules, and downloadable application forms. Also featured on this website are videos that I created using previous yearsâ€™ pictures and video clips. In addition, I created a sponsors page to display the sponsors and link to their websites.
