  <p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p><br />
  <p><strong>What is Destination STEM?</strong><br />We are a non-profit organization that develops and implements summer camps and other community outreach activities designed to promote girls' early engagement in STEM, encourage higher education, and create gender equity in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.</p>
  <p><strong>Who can attend these Destination summer camps and how do I sign up?</strong><br />
  Any girls entering grades 3 to 9 can attend, but spaces are limited, so sign up early.  Application forms and descriptions of the camps can be found on our <a href="camps.html">camps</a> page.</p>
  <p><strong>Why are the summer camps for girls only?</strong><br />A particular goal of Destination STEM is to help increase the representation of women in STEM careers, where they are typically underrepresented. We believe that by fostering the interests of girls in STEM at an early age, we can help address our nation's STEM workforce gender inequities.</p>
  <p><strong>Are the summer camps really free?  What's the catch?</strong><br />There is no catch!  Our summer camps are absolutely free, and they are supported by our generous <a href="sponsors.html">sponsors</a>.  If you would like to support our programs, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@destinationSTEM.org">info@destinationSTEM.org</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>What are the summer camps like?</strong><br />Our summer camps are designed to foster girls' curiosity and interest in STEM by immersing them in hands-on activities and introducing them to positive female role-models. In addition to learning to think analytically and creatively, our campers also learn teamwork skills while in a fun environment.</p>
